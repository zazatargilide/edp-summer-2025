## ❓ FAQ

### ❔ What if I can't attend 80% of classes?
If you know ahead of time you won’t meet the attendance requirement (visa issues, work, health, etc.):
- You **must inform me no later than during the 4th class** of the semester.
- Depending on your situation, I may prepare an individual exam or self-study resources to help you complete the course faster.

---

### ❔ What code editor should I use?
- We'll mainly use **GitHub CodeSpaces**.
- For simpler exercises, we may use **Jupyter Notebooks**: [Try JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/index.html).

---

### ❔ Can I use ChatGPT (or other LLMs)?
> **Short answer: Yes — and you should!**
>
> However, AI is a **double-edged sword**. It can offer great support but also lead you astray if not used wisely.
>
> **Treat AI as your sparring partner** — challenge it, ask it questions, and let it help you learn.  
> Remember: at the end of the course, you will need to **pass a one-on-one exam with me** — no AI assistance allowed then!
